# Technologies

1. React.js 18.1.0
2. React Native 0.70.3
3. Giphy React Native SDK 1.11.1
4. React Navigation 6.0.13

# Setup Instructions

1. Visit https://github.com/michael-williamson/Giphy_Demo & click on green button with title "Code" or simple copy this address https://github.com/michael-williamson/Giphy_Demo.git into the terminal & folder on your computer. Now type "git clone https://github.com/michael-williamson/Giphy_Demo.git" & hit enter. The project will be copied into that folder.

2. In the terminal using whatever package manager type e.g. "npm install" & this will install any dependencies necessary to run the project

3. You will need a couple of API keys available @ https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk. You will need an API key associated with React Native SDK & an API key associated with the Giphy API.

4. Once these keys are available create a file in the root folder "keys.tsx" & inside this file create an exported object "export const keys = {
   GIPHY_DEMO_SDK_KEY:"YOUR_SDK_KEY",
   GIPHY_DEMO_API_KEY:"YOUR_API_KEY"
   }
   "
5. Very Important!! Now add "keys.tsx" in the .gitignore file to prevent any Keys being pushed to a public repository.

6. After configuring an emulator to run React Native, type either npx react-native run-android

# Notes

!! important: There are some Object properties in the Giphy API that may not contain values thus returning undefined. It is important to consider handling this possibility so that
it doesn't break the app. One example is here: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/schema#image-object In the first paragraph " (Please note that some GIFs donâ€™t have every property available.)"
